## HTTP:

Doesn't look like anything useful but we know the webpage is running as ``ISI 6.0`` from Nmap results.

So I started searching for exploits available for it.

Later I found this 

> https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/windows/iis/iis_webdav_scstoragepathfromurl

So I opened my ``metasploit`` and tried that exploit.[br/](br/)

And I checked whether its vulnerable or not and yeah its vulnerable.

I got the shell[br/](br/)

## Privilege Escalation:

Background the Session and Lets try ``local_exploit_suggester``[br/](br/)
![Untitled](/img/htb-grandpa/6.png)[br/](br/)
Seems like lot of exploits. Before doing that we need to ``migrate`` process inorder to make it stable. So I won't face any errors while using any exploit.

Now we can try the exploits, I selected randomly, Started from lastone.

It worked!! We got Authority\System[br/](br/)
